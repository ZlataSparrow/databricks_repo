# Databricks Machine Learning

This repo contains my Databricks-based machine learning and data engineering experiments.

I use **Apache Spark**, **PySpark**, and **Databricks Machine Learning** for scalable data science workflows.

All notebooks were developed and executed in a Databricks workspace environment, applying distributed data processing, feature engineering, and model training at scale.

## 🧭 Overview

The primary objective of this repository is to illustrate how large-volume data can be transformed, analyzed, and modeled efficiently using the **Databricks Lakehouse Platform**.  
Current projects focus on end-to-end workflows — from ingestion and transformation to model training and evaluation.

Projects:  

📊 **Customer Churn Prediction** — training and evaluating classification models using Spark MLlib to identify customers at risk of churn.
